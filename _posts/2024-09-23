Adding the finishing touches to both the literature review and research proposal. In the literature review, I drafted the implications section, wrote the abstract, added the references, and reviewed the overall formatting.

This has been an incredible experience, and I have learned a lot throughout the summer. I appreciated the opportunity to think deeply about my research question, explore the literature to identify relevant theories and frameworks, design research methodologies, develop a recruitment strategy, and carefully consider the study's measurements and data analysis. I am especially grateful that my advisor allowed me to research a topic I am personally fascinated by. I look forward to seeing how this research topic evolves in the future.
