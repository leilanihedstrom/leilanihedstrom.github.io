title: Week 2
---
In week two, I worked on a second draft of the experimental protocol. I reviewed the literature to explore potential theories that could explain my hypotheses. Some of the theories I came across include Media Richness Theory, Social Presence Theory, Impression Management, technology-mediated interviews, social-emotional interaction, and anthropomorphism, such as natural face technology and realistic visual presence. Additionally, I spent time learning about online research participant platforms such as MTurk and Prolific to identify my recruitment strategy and the step-by-step experiment procedures, specifically how to differentiate the two experimental groups.
