title: Week 1

Prior to the first week, my advisor and I had already met a couple of times to brainstorm my research topics and my goals during and after the DREAM program. I expressed my interest in producing original work and ultimately working towards my first publication. I also communicated a few of my research topics, and we ultimately decided to investigate the use of Artificial Intelligence in video interview platforms and its effect on interviewees' emotional and behavioral responses, as well as their performance.

During my one-on-one with my advisor, we revisited our previously identified research topic and determined that the next step would be to work towards getting IRB approval, starting with creating an experimental protocol. Additionally, this week, I was given a tour of the lab where I will be working for the rest of the summer. I also met three other students in the lab. We took turns introducing ourselves and the research projects we are each working on. I drafted the first version of the experimental protocol and completed the required CITI research ethics, compliance, and safety training.
