## About Me

Hello world! I’m Leilani, and thank you for checking out my DREAM research project website. The Distributed REsearch Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) is funded by the National Science Foundation with the goal of encouraging students without a computing undergraduate degree and currently pursuing a computing Master’s to consider a PhD in computing.

I studied Psychology during my undergraduate years at the University of North Florida and worked as a research assistant at the Cognition Lab for two semesters. Then I went on to pursue my Master’s in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with an emphasis on cross-cultural research at Roosevelt University. I graduated in 2015 and have since worked in the recruitment and hiring field for 8 years. In 2021, I took a break from corporate life to pursue a lifelong dream of thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, a solo 2,600+ mile journey from Mexico to Canada in the wilderness. This adventure provided time for introspection and reevaluating my next career step. In 2023, I decided to return to school to pursue an MS in Human-Computer Interaction and I am on track to graduate in March 2026. 

My research interest is driven by my personal experience working in the recruitment and hiring field, and my exposure to automated candidate tracking and selection software. I witnessed both the benefits and apprehensions of automation and AI-assisted hiring, as such decisions are among the most regulated yet subjective ones made within organizations. My passion is to understand and uncover the ramifications of human-AI interaction and human-AI collaboration in the recruitment and hiring field, with the aim of contributing to designing successful and responsible hiring technologies for the future.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Faculty-and-Staff/Pages/faculty-info.aspx?fid=1631">David Ramsay</a> is an Assistant Professor at DePaul University and Director of the <a href="https://irl.depaul.edu/">Idea Realization Lab</a> Makerspaces. He earned his PhD in 2023 from the MIT Media Lab's Responsive Environments group under Dr. Joe Paradiso, studying how tool design alters daily attention dynamics. He integrates high-quality hardware systems with cutting-edge statistical modeling to enhance human experience.

A Fulbright-winning researcher, David spent years as an audio systems engineer at Bose Research before his PhD. At MIT, he worked on embedded machine learning models at Google AI and studied manufacturing in Shenzhen under Dr. Bunnie Huang. He created and taught MIT’s first for-credit class on psychology’s replication crisis and was nominated for MIT’s Goodwin Teaching Award. He has lectured in Dr. Roz Picard’s ‘AI and Mental Health’ class which has received two best paper awards and two patents, with his work featured on NPR and exhibited at the MIT Museum.

His area of research include:
<ul>
    <li> Human Computer Interaction </li>
    <li> Social Aspects of Computing </li>
    <li> Next generation Sensing Systems </li>
</ul>

## About My Project

My research project aims to examine the effect of perceived social presence, whether interacting with a human or AI in a job interview, on interviewees’ communication style, behavior, emotional response, and performance. The goal is to understand how the interviewer's perceived nature (human or AI) impacts interview outcomes.

My advisor, Dr. David Ramsay, allowed me to use the DREAM opportunity to pursue this research topic of personal interest. The 10-week summer timeline will serve as a foundation for my Master’s thesis. With my advisor's guidance, I will generate a research proposal and a literature review, which will include identifying research questions, formulating hypotheses, and designing a research protocol. Post-DREAM, I will execute the experiment, analyze data, draw conclusions, and submit for my first academic publication.
