## About Me

Hello world! I’m Leilani, and thank you for checking out my DREAM research project website. The Distributed REsearch Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) is funded by the National Science Foundation and MSCS Consortium partners to encourage participants in underrepresened groups' to pursue a PhD in Computing. 

I studied Psychology during my undergraduate years at the University of North Florida and worked as a research assistant at the Cognition Lab for two semesters. Then I went on to pursue my Master’s in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with an emphasis on cross-cultural research at Roosevelt University. I graduated in 2015 and have since worked in the recruitment and hiring field for 8 years. Driven by curiosity and a desire for a career change, I began exploring the field of User Experience/User Interface. In 2023, I decided to return to school, where I began my current field of study in a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction, and I am on track to graduate in December 2025.

My research interest is driven by my personal experience working in the recruitment and hiring field, and my exposure to automated candidate tracking and selection software. I witnessed both the benefits and apprehensions of automation and AI-assisted hiring, as such decisions are among the most regulated yet subjective ones made within organizations. My passion is to understand and uncover the ramifications of human-AI interaction and human-AI collaboration in the recruitment and hiring field, with the aim of contributing to designing successful and responsible hiring technologies for the future.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Faculty-and-Staff/Pages/faculty-info.aspx?fid=1631">David Ramsay</a> is an Assistant Professor at DePaul University and Director of the <a href="https://irl.depaul.edu/">Idea Realization Lab</a> Makerspaces. He earned his PhD in 2023 from the MIT Media Lab's Responsive Environments group under Dr. Joe Paradiso, studying how tool design alters daily attention dynamics. He integrates high-quality hardware systems with cutting-edge statistical modeling to enhance human experience.

A Fulbright-winning researcher, David spent years as an audio systems engineer at Bose Research before his PhD. At MIT, he worked on embedded machine learning models at Google AI and studied manufacturing in Shenzhen under Dr. Bunnie Huang. He created and taught MIT’s first for-credit class on psychology’s replication crisis and was nominated for MIT’s Goodwin Teaching Award. He has lectured in Dr. Roz Picard’s ‘AI and Mental Health’ class which has received two best paper awards and two patents, with his work featured on NPR and exhibited at the MIT Museum.

His area of research include:
<ul>
    <li> Human Computer Interaction </li>
    <li> Social Aspects of Computing </li>
    <li> Next generation Sensing Systems </li>
</ul>

## About My Project

My research project examines the impact of perceived social presence in technology-mediated job interviews, focusing on how virtual interactions with human versus AI interviewers affect interviewees' communication styles, behaviors, emotional responses, and performance. Leveraging Social Presence Theory (SPT) (Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976) and Media Richness Theory (MRT) (Daft & Lengel, 1986), this study explores how social cues influence impression management and effective communication in high-stress scenarios such as employment interviews. Previous research indicates that job seekers perform better with enhanced impression management facilitated by non-verbal cues in face-to-face settings (Basch, Kegelmann, & Lieb, 2020).

With the rise of anthropomorphic AI, this study investigates how hyper-realistic AI technologies influence social presence and interview dynamics. Emerging findings suggest job seekers behave differently when interacting with AI compared to human interviewers (Suen & Hung, 2024). The goal is to understand how the perceived nature of the interviewer (human or AI) impacts interviewees, offering insights into the future of human-AI interaction in recruitment and hiring technologies.
