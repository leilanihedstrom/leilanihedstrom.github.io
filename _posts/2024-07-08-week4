This week, I worked on visual assets for the AI experimental condition. I realized that to make the deception effective, a brief presentation on the key features and functionalities of the hypothetical AI interviewing software was necessary before the interview simulation. I created branding, a name, a brochure, and screen mockups for the fictitious AI interviewing software. To make it believable, I introduced the AI interviewing platform as a Zoom plug-in offering a hyper-realistic, user-friendly interviewing experience with feedback.
