title: Week 3 (07/01/24 - 07/05/24)
---
This week was heavily focused on writing, as I spent the majority of my time refining my experimental protocol for IRB submission. I also created the supplemental materials needed for the protocol, including simulated interview questions and their intended reasoning for use in the experiment, the experimental questionnaire, informed consent and debrief forms, and an experimental script to be spoken during the experiment. I particularly struggled with finding the right questionnaire items to include, realizing that an empirically validated instrument would be necessary for my experiment. Many validated scales are often not included in research papers, requiring more diligence in finding alternatives. This process also made me critically evaluate the key outcomes I would like to measure, whether they are trust, transparency, interview experience, social presence, or something else.
