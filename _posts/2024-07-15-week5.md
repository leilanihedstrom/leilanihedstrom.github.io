title: Week 5 (07/15/24 - 07/19/24)
---
This week, I had some downtime while awaiting feedback on my experimental protocol and IRB submission documents. I used this time to catch up on DREAM milestone tasks. I created my DREAM project website on GitHub and reviewed other students' progress. I am incredibly impressed by their projects, which have truly inspired me to make the most of this opportunity. I feel fortunate for the introductions and connections I’ve made so far, meeting my advisor, other students in the research lab, and my mentor. These interactions have already made this experience worthwhile.

For my weekly blog, I reviewed my research notes and reflected on the ups and downs of the past five weeks. Time has flown by, and I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface of my research topic. I am slightly anxious and overwhelmed by the gap between my expectations and my actual progress. Additionally, I spent the week contemplating my future, considering a potential path as a computing PhD student and its implications for me and my family.
